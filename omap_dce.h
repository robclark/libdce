/* Please note that modifications to all structs defined here are subject to
 * backwards-compatibility constraints.
 *
 * Cacheability and control structs:
 * ------------ --- ------- --------
 * All the ioctl params w/ names ending in _bo are GEM buffer object handles
 * for control structures that are shared with the coprocessor.  You probably
 * want to create them as uncached or writecombine.
 *
 * NOTE: The DCE ioctl calls are synchronous, and the coprocessor will not
 * access the control structures passed as parameters other than during
 * the duration of the ioctl call that they are passed to.  So if we avoid
 * adding asynchronous ioctl calls (or if we do, if userspace brackets CPU
 * access to the control structures with OMAP_GEM_CPU_PREP/OMAP_GEM_CPU_FINI),
 * we could handle the necessary clean/invalidate ops in the ioctl handlers.
 * But for now be safe and use OMAP_BO_WC.
 *
 * About resuming interrupted ioctl calls:
 * ----- -------- ----------- ----- ------
 * In the ioctl command structs which return values, there is a 'token'
 * field.  Userspace should initially set this value to zero.  If the
 * syscall is interrupted, the driver will set a (file-private) token
 * value, and userspace should loop and re-start the ioctl returning the
 * token value that the driver set.  This allows the driver to realize
 * that it is a restarted syscall, and that it should simply wait for a
 * response from coprocessor rather than starting a new request.
